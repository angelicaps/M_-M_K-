# M_-M_K-

This code is meant to provide realistic masses and uncertainties of M dwarfs given a user-provided 2MASS K and distance (and uncertainties!). The code will then read in the included posterior from Mann et al. (when I get around to it...) to estimate the error arising from scatter in the relation itself. The output is a posterior on stellar mass (Solar units). 

If users prefer 1D errors, let me know and I can make it output that. 

The code is available in IDL or python.
